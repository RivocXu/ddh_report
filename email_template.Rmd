#### Hey `r params$name`,  
`r email_greeting` Attached you will find a zipped file containing:  

- `r glue::glue("{good_file_name}_REPORT.html")` 
- a directory of *figures* for each of the images in the report, to easily include in presentations or manuscripts  
  
Also, you can always head back to the data-driven hypothesis website to explore `r input_report$query` further by clicking the button below.

`r search_button(private = private_report, type = input_report$type, query = input_report$query)`

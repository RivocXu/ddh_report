This interactive network graph shows the top 10 genes with similar co-essientiality profiles as `r params$input`, and then fetches each of their top 10. An edge connection is made between two genes when they each are present in the top 10 of eachother's list. This is a way for users to prioritize strong networks of functional relationships.

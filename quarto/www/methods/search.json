    "title": "Data-driven Hypothesis",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Imagine interrogating 100s of GBs of data by simply querying your gene of interest to develop a hypothesis before testing it. This is data-driven hypothesis.\n\n\n\nIdentifying the key functions of human genes is a major biomedical research goal. While some genes are very well-studied, most human genes we know little about. Mapping a broad set of gene functions en masse is currently not possible, and therefore most scientific research proceeds with a one-gene-at-a-time approach. While this reductionist approach has guided the scientific methods for hundreds of years, the volume, complexity, and sophistication of modern science necessitate alternative approaches.\nCurrent incentives in science encourage study of a few genes, where many of the ~20,000 genes remain understudied.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of publications per human gene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew tools in Data Science – a combination of computer programming, math & statistics, and topical expertise – combined with the rapid adoption of open science and data sharing allow scientists to access publicly available datasets and interrogate these data before performing any experiments.\nSuch tools allow researchers to identify new hypotheses for well-studied genes, or new processes for un-annotated genes. Indeed, most human genes are poorly studied, perhaps because of the intractability to study them with no prior knowledge.\nThis project aims to address this challenge. Welcome to data-driven hypothesis.\nThe overall goal of the data-driven hypothesis (DDH) project is to use new tools in Data Science to generate hypotheses supported by data that can be tested in the lab. Several high-quality, publicly available datasets are published online and made available with Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licenses. The advent and rapid adoption of data-sharing platforms, such as figshare.com have provided high-quality data sets for public interrogation.\nThis project began as an extension of a simple and common concept called pattern recognition – looking for patterns in large datasets that might reveal similarities between common genes. As one simple example, common gene expression patterns can be revealed using gene co-expression analysis. When a gene of unknown function is identified, one strategy to learn something about the new gene is to identify shared patterns of expression with other genes. If unknown Gene X is expressed with known genes A, B, and C, then you can infer that Gene X might be part of a functional module with A, B, C. This approach is particularly powerful when genes A, B, and C are part of a known biological pathway, which leads to the hypothesis that Gene X might also be part of that same pathway.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap label\n\n\n\n\nBeyond this simple example, we aim to leverage several different types of data glean information about known and unknown genes. We present here a comprehensive resource for mapping the structure or function of thousands of genes across the human genome. Importantly, this method integrates several data types, including gene essentiality, gene expression, and literature mining to identify candidate functions of known or unknown genes. The DDH project holds tremendous promise to generate hypotheses, data, and knowledge in order to provide a deep understanding of the dynamic properties of an organism. We provide this resource via an intuitive online interface, which will provide the scientific community a platform to query and prioritize experimental hypotheses to test in the lab.\n\n\n\nLike the proverbial man searching for his lost keys under the lamp post because the light shines there, searching for biological truths often occurs under ‘lamp posts’ because that’s where scientists can see. But what if your keys are not under the light? Or your gene is totally unknown? What do you do?\nThe scientific method has guided scientific minds for hundreds of years, starting with a question, followed by a hypothesis, and then an experimental path to test the prediction. While hypotheses are the bedrock of science, the volume, complexity, and sophistication of modern science necessitate new methods to generate hypotheses.\nNew tools in Data Science – a combination of computer programming, math & statistics, and topical expertise – combined with the rapid adoption of open science and data sharing allow scientists to access publicly available datasets and interrogate these data before performing any experiments.\nImagine having strong data to support your new hypothesis before testing it. This is data-driven hypothesis."

A cell line is represented by a single point on the plot. Generally, values below -1 indicate the gene of interest (ROCK1 in this example) is essential in that cell line; values between -1 and 0, mean that cells lose fitness, but the gene is not essential; values hovering around zero indicate that ablation of ROCK1 has little effect on cell growth; values above 1, indicate that knocking-out the gene leads to a fitness advantage. In the case of ROCK1, several cells have a fitness advantage in its absence, consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor.\nThe second plot is a density plot of dependency scores, showing the distribution of scores for ROCK1. While the majority of cells have little change in cellular growth when ROCK1 is absent (the density plot is centered around zero), some cells require ROCK1 for growth (cells scoring below -1), whereas in other cells ROCK1 functions as a tumor suppressor (cells with a score above 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo identify the cells at the tails of the plots, a dependency table will show the ranked cells by dependency score, with cell lineage information appended.

However, the strength of the hypothesis cannot be fully inferred from single gene list. If a new gene is associated with the queried gene, then you might infer a functional relationship. However, if you inspect the top 10 genes with the queried gene, then inspect the top 10 genes of each of those, building a functional network graph of the top related genes might reveal a stronger association of the new gene with your queried gene and its top ranked genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisNetwork\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe image here is a representative static, albeit busy, network graph; data presented on datadrivenhypothesis.org is an interactive image that can be zoomed, dragged, and manipulated for data exploration."

If we have a hypothesis about the little orange protein, we might go to the lab to test it in order to see if it interacts with somebody or see if it participates in a process that we happen to study.\nThere are a lot of different approaches that we can take in order to identify the function for these proteins. But again, all of these are hypothetical and require this direct testing in the lab. Now we can expand this concept from the single orange protein to all of the proteins in the cell, and it turns out that functionally mapping human genes to pathways, it still remains a major biomedical goal.\nI imagine that most readers are working towards a goal that looks something like this: you have a gene, or a protein, or a process that you’re trying to better understand what it could be doing in your system. The question that that is driving this project is how can we save time when testing a new idea?\nThis project is primarily centered around a single question:\nWhat does [insert favorite gene] do?\nOf course, the answers are much more complicated than the single question.

The small GTPase Rho regulates formation of focal adhesions and stress fibers of fibroblasts, as well as adhesion and aggregation of platelets and lymphocytes by shuttling between the inactive GDP-bound form and the active GTP-bound form. Rho is also essential in cytokinesis and plays a role in transcriptional activation by serum response factor. This protein, a downstream effector of Rho, phosphorylates and activates LIM kinase, which in turn, phosphorylates cofilin, inhibiting its actin-depolymerizing activity. A pseudogene, related to this gene, is also located on chromosome 18.

Beyond a single gene, this application can handle pathways or multi gene queries. To search a pathway, type the pathway name into the search just as you would a gene inquiry. If you have a specific GO number for the pathway, you can also type this in. Lastly, you can simply type in a custom set of genes that you want to query.\n\n\nCell Line Search\nSimilar to a gene query, you can also search for a cell line of interest. Approximately 1000 cell lines are included in this resource. Simply type the name of a single cell line and the app will return a list of best matches. Additionally, users can search for a cell lineage or linear subtype, which is a collection of defined cells. Finally, a custom set of cells can also be queried.\n\n\nCompound Search\nA compound search consists of either a drug or metabolite. This unique search type will return information about the compound. Furthermore, it will return information about the genes that are known to handle the metabolite, or are targeted by the compound. Like the other search types, defined lists of compounds can be queried for a metabolic pathway, or a common mechanism of action for drugs. Lastly a custom set of drugs or metabolites can be queried."

The way search works in the app:\
1. A user enters a gene (or cell, compound) into a usual input search query\
2. Search looks through a few different dataframes (for different search types) and returns URLs  
3. The URL is then built with the search terms  
4. The page is built with values in the URL  
5. The user can navigate to various elements on that page

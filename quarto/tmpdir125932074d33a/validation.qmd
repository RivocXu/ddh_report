In order to identify the functional annotation of a single gene, begin with a query. Entering a single gene in the search box produces a series of tables and plots that identifies a functional map of the processes that gene *might* be involved in. In some cases, querying a gene with known functions will identify genes with well-established connections to the query gene; in other cases, new genes and new biological process might be identified, suggesting there is more to discover for well-known pathways. Querying unknown genes is especially powerful, as the associated genes and pathways provide a starting point for an otherwise difficult problem to prioritize experimentally.
